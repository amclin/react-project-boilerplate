# %%APPNAME%%

This is a boilerplate React project incorporating NextJS, CICD pipelines, unit testing, quality gates, and code styling. It is useful for ensuring consistent working environments across multiple different applications.

## Running

### Dependencies

After checking out this repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Running in Dev Mode

Run `npm run dev` to launch a NextJS development webserver at `http://localhost:3000`

### Running in Production Mode

For convenience and consistency, the preferred method of running in produciton mode is to use Docker. This will best match how an application is running on a shared environment.

#### Build a Docker image

Create a Docker image from your current source code by running:

`npm run docker`

**Warning** You must have Docker Desktop or similar Docker daemon installed and running or the script will fail.

#### Run a Docker Container

Once the Docker image exists in your registry of choice (local or remote), you can then run the app and specify what port it should run on:

```
docker run -p 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 %%APPNAME%%:latest
```

If you'd like to run on a different port, replace the first `3000` with the desired port.

#### Alternative "local" production mode

Alternatively the application can be run locally without using Docker. See [NextJS documentation for more details](https://nextjs.org/docs#production-deployment).

## Enviornmental Variables

For nextjs, add these `process.env.<VAR>` will be found in `next.config.js` to be used in the `publicRuntimeConfig` for access inside the app. (This is so nextjs can make sure `process.env` doesn't get hard coded in the build file like webpack does).

Use `APP_ENV` to define the enviornment (i.e. `default`, `dev`, `qa`, `prod`).

Use `API_GATEWAY_URL` to specify the gateway.

### Version Page

**For SSR**, the route is `/api/version`.

**For static sites**, the route is `/version.html`.

> NOTE: As you add new environmental variables that should be on this version page, also place them here.
